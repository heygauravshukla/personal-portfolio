## The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load.
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.

## Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) - JS library for mobile-friendly interactive maps
- [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) - API to look up IP locations accurately
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) - Fast, disk space efficient package manager

## What I learned

This project enhanced my understanding of several key concepts, including:

- Integrating external APIs into a Next.js project and managing dynamic responses effectively.
- Implementing interactive map features using the Leaflet library.
- Securing sensitive information, such as API keys, through environment variables to prevent exposure in public repositories.
- Utilizing Next.js Server-Side Rendering (SSR) to handle API requests securely, thereby avoiding key exposure in network traffic.
