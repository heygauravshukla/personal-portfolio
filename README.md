### Useful resources

- [A YouTube video on "MDX in Next.js is Easy Now" by Colby Fayock](https://youtu.be/MsSUAOkepCw?si=gSpeXXL_cV4xJlan) -
  Learned how to set up MDX in a Next.js app using the Next.js MDX package and how we can configure remote content, such
  as from a separate local directory, using `next-mdx-remote`.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) - Used it to get brand icons in SVG format defined in the `icons.tsx` file.
- [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app) - Used it to optimize the image assets and convert them to `.webp` format.
